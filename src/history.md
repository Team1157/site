<h2> 2020 - Present </h2>
<h3> MATE and the Robosharks </h3>
<p>After the cancelation of the FRC regional due to the pandemic in 2020, we switched to the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) ROV Competition. We found the new competition provided unique challenges, and we decided to continue with MATE. Since then we have competed at the World Championships each year. With the change in competition, our team name changed as well. No longer the Landsharks, we found our way into the water and became the Robosharks.</p>
<h2>Competition - FRC 2008-2019</h2>
<h3>Landshark</h3>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first year the team was called the Landsharks; however, the information we have from this time is sparse. If you have information about this era of the Robosharks, please reach out.</p>
<h2>2005 - 2007</h2>
<h3>The BoulderBots</h3>
<p>"Team 1157 - the BoulderBots - have competed in an international high school level competition called FIRST. Students from Boulder High - though any local high school student is invited to join - create a 120 pound robot with help from community sponsors and mentors. This robot is designed to accomplish a specific strategy to win a game outlined yearly by FIRST. In 2005, for example, robots were required to stack hollow tetrahedrons (3 sided pyramids) on top of 6-foot goals. In all of a few minutes a single game is complete, but the entire tournament takes two full days to finish." -The team's 2005 website (accessed via the wayback machine)</p>
<h2>2003 - 2004</h2>
<h3>Hippie Bots</h3>
<p>The robotics club was founded by a couple of seniors, and, upon the first meeting having much more turnout than expected, the computer teacher and the team's mentor, Mike Fuchs, decided to use FIRST as a way to teach robotics to the group. Mr. Fuchs christened the team the Hippie Bots.</p>
<p>"FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international, high school level robotics competition, founded with the ultimate goal that science and engineering would become more culturally mainstream. The BHS Team - Team 1157 - is just one of many teams who compete in the FIRST competition. We first competed in 2003, as a part of the Seattle FIRST regional. In 2004, the Colorado FIRST regional chapter held its first competition, and we attended that competition held at Denver University. Also in 2004, we attended the national competition in Atlanta, having won a lottery slot issued to rookie teams. The 2005 competition is just around the corner..." -The team's 2004 site, accessed via a screenshot that was on the team Google Drive</p>
