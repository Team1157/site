<h2> 2019 - Present </h2>
<h3> MATE and the Robosharks </h3>
<p>In 2020 we switched over to the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) ROV Competition after the FRC regional was cancelled due to the pandemic. We've stuck with it ever since, and have competed at the World Championships each year. Our switch to MATE also heralded a rebranding. No longer the Landsharks, we found our way into the water and became the Robosharks.</p>
<h2>Competition - FRC 2008-2015</h2>
<h3>Landshark</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell this is the first year the team was called the Landsharks, but the information I have through this time period is a little spotty. PLEASE REACH OUT IF YOU HAVE INFO</p>
<h2>2005 - 2007</h2>
<h3>The BoulderBots</h3>
<p>"Team 1157 - the BoulderBots - have competed in an international high school level competition called FIRST. Students from Boulder High - though any local high school student is invited to join - create a 120 pound robot with help from community sponsors and mentors. This robot is designed to accomplish a specific strategy to win a game outlined yearly by FIRST. In 2005, for example, robots were required to stack hollow tetrahedrons (3 sided pyramids) on top of 6-foot goals. In all of a few minutes a single game is complete, but the entire tournament takes two full days to finish." -The team's 2005 website (accessed via the wayback machine)</p>
<h2>2003 - 2004</h2>
<h3>Hippie Bots</h3>
<p>Their first season, the robotics club was started by a couple of seniors, and upon the first meeting having much more turnout than expected, the computer teacher decided to use FIRST as a way to teach robotics to the group. The team was christened the Hippie Bots by their first mentor, Mike Fuchs</p>
<p>"FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international, high school level robotics competition, founded with the ultimate goal that science and engineering would become more culturally mainstream. The BHS Team - Team 1157 - is just one of many teams who compete in the FIRST competition. We first competed in 2003, as a part of the Seattle FIRST regional. In 2004, the Colorado FIRST regional chapter held its first competition, and we attended that competition held at Denver University. Also in 2004, we attended the national competition in Atlanta, having won a lottery slot issued to rookie teams. The 2005 competition is just around the corner..." -The team's 2004 site, accessed via a screenshot that was on the team Google Drive</p>
