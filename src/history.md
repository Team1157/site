<h2>Competition - MATE 2024</h2>
<h3>Mako</h3>

</div>
<p>This year we went with a completely new design; Mako didn't have a conventional frame, instead utilizing a set of rails around the drybox which served as adjustable attachment points for the thrusters, camera, and manipulator. Designed for power and finesse over symmetricallity, Mako was capable of extremely fast forward movement and precise rotation.</p>

<h3>Bubbles</h3>

  <div class="arrow" onclick="expandImage(this)">&#9660;</div>
</div>
<p>An iteration of the earlier Boxfish ROV, Bubbles utilized a similar frame structure, but with 8 thrusters placed at the corners of the frame, allowing for near-symmetrical movement in any orientation. Designed to have pair of cameras and manipulators on both sides, Bubbles was able to quickly shift between tasks at ease, without needing precious time to swing the around to face the new focus.</p>

<p>Our first foray into the MATE ROV competition, Hammerhead was designed to be extremely versatile. The width of the front manipulator provided an extremely stable platform to move and interact with most objects she encountered.</p>

<h2>Competition - FRC 2008-2015</h2>
<h3>Landshark</h3>
<p>As far as I can tell this is the first year the team was called the Landsharks, but the information I have through this time period is a little spotty. PLEASE REACH OUT IF YOU HAVE INFO</p>
<h2>Vision - 2007</h2>
<h3>1157 has seen the light</h3>
<p>"This year has been going very well for us. We think we are about a week to a week and a half from a fully functioning robot and… We have turned into a moth that can’t stay away from the little green light. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1p7XGtWFE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1p7XGtWFE</a> That is our 2006 robot fully functional and tracking the light. We have made several circuits of our computer lab since we got it running. It will back off if the light moves too high and will move forward if the light gets too low. The driving has also been integrated with the light so that we can translate sideways and forward/backward while still facing the light to make it easier to place tubes during normal play. This year’s bot will have an almost identical drive train so updating the code will involve some gain changes but otherwise be “effortless”." -taken from chiefdelphi post 77041</p>
<h2>Competition - FRC 2005 - 2007</h2>
<h3>The BoulderBots</h3>
<p>"Team 1157 - the BoulderBots - have competed in an international high school level competition called FIRST. Students from Boulder High - though any local high school student is invited to join - create a 120 pound robot with help from community sponsors and mentors. This robot is designed to accomplish a specific strategy to win a game outlined yearly by FIRST. In 2005, for example, robots were required to stack hollow tetrahedrons (3 sided pyramids) on top of 6-foot goals. In all of a few minutes a single game is complete, but the entire tournament takes two full days to finish." -The team's 2005 website (accessed via the wayback machine)</p>
<h2>Competition - FRC 2003 - 2004</h2>
<h3>Hippie Bots</h3>
<p>Their first season, the robotics club was started by a couple of seniors, and upon the first meeting having much more turnout than expected, the computer teacher decided to use FIRST as a way to teach robotics to the group. The team was christened the Hippie Bots by their first mentor, Mike Fuchs</p>
<p>"FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is an international, high school level robotics competition, founded with the ultimate goal that science and engineering would become more culturally mainstream. The BHS Team - Team 1157 - is just one of many teams who compete in the FIRST competition. We first competed in 2003, as a part of the Seattle FIRST regional. In 2004, the Colorado FIRST regional chapter held its first competition, and we attended that competition held at Denver University. Also in 2004, we attended the national competition in Atlanta, having won a lottery slot issued to rookie teams. The 2005 competition is just around the corner..." -The team's 2004 site, accessed via a screenshot that was on the team Google Drive</p>
