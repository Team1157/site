<h2>Competition - MATE 2024</h2>
<h3>Mako</h3>
<img src="/img/Mako_Image_Bad.jpg?url" alt="Mako ROV from MATE 2024">
<p>This year we went with a completely new design; Mako didn't have a conventional frame, instead utilizing a set of rails around the drybox which served as adjustable attachment points for the thrusters, camera, and manipulator. Designed for power and finesse over symmetry, Mako was capable of extremely fast forward movement and precise rotation.</p>

<h2>Competition - MATE 2023</h2>
<h3>Bubbles</h3>

<p>An iteration of the earlier Boxfish ROV, Bubbles utilized a similar frame structure, but with 8 thrusters placed at the corners of the frame, allowing for near-symmetrical movement in any orientation. Designed to have a pair of cameras and manipulators on both sides, Bubbles was able to quickly shift between tasks at ease, without needing precious time to swing around to face the new focus.</p>

<h3>Hammerhead</h3>

<p>Our first foray into the MATE ROV competition, Hammerhead was designed to be extremely versatile. The width of the front manipulator provided an extremely stable platform to move and interact with most objects she encountered.</p>

<h2>Vision - 2007</h2>
<h3>1157 has seen the light</h3>
<p>"This year has been going very well for us. We think we are about a week to a week and a half from a fully functioning robot and… We have turned into a moth that can’t stay away from the little green light. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1p7XGtWFE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx1p7XGtWFE</a> That is our 2006 robot fully functional and tracking the light. We have made several circuits of our computer lab since we got it running. It will back off if the light moves too high and will move forward if the light gets too low. The driving has also been integrated with the light so that we can translate sideways and forward/backward while still facing the light to make it easier to place tubes during normal play. This year’s bot will have an almost identical drive train so updating the code will involve some gain changes but otherwise be “effortless”." -taken from chiefdelphi post 77041</p>
