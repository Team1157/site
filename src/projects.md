### Competition - MATE 20204

#### Mako

![Mako](/<Mako_Image_Bad.jpg>)

A completely new design, Mako had didn't have a conventional frame, instead utilizing a set of rails around the drybox which served as adjustable attachment points for the thrusters, camera, and manipulator. Designed for power and finesse over symmetricallity, Mako was capable of extremely fast forward movement and precise rotation.

### Competition - MATE 2023

#### Bubbles

![Bubbles](/<Bubbles!.jpg>)

An iteration of the earlier Boxfish ROV, Bubbles utilized a similar frame structure, but with 8 thrusters placed at the corners of the frame, allowing for near-symmetrical movement in any orientation. Designed to have pair of cameras and manipulators on both sides, Bubbles was able to quickly shift between tasks at ease, without needing precious time to swing the around to face the new focus.
